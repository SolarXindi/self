Wrote and executed a (mostly) successful migration of over 200 million records from a Microsoft SQL Server (COBOL schema*) to another freshly designed / built Microsoft SQL Server, using a multi-threaded (spawns new processes) C# program to migrate in "phases" based on data hierarchy (parent data first then move onto children)

*COBOL Schema means all columns are six characters (e.g. SYSDAT), no foreign keys / data integrity and no individual table primary keys
